# Functional Movie Search

> a frontend example app built with functional principles in mind

The **[live demo](https://sophiabrandt.github.io/functional-movie-search/)** is hosted on Github Pages. You can search for movie titles by typing into the search bar and submitting your search.  
The app will query the [Open Movie Database](https://www.omdbapi.com/).  
Click on an image to see more information (leads to the [IMDB Website](https://www.imdb.com)).  
If no image is available, you'll see a cute [kitten](https://placekitten.com).

## Motivation

This is an exercise in building a mostly functional frontend app **without** a framework like React & Redux.

Part of the code is from [Functional Programming For Beginners with JavaScript](https://courses.knowthen.com/p/functional-programming-for-beginners-with-javascript).
