# Functional Movie Search

> a frontend example app built with functional principles in mind

The **[live demo](https://sophiabrandt.github.io/functional-movie-search/)** is hosted on Github Pages. You can search for movie titles by typing into the search bar and submitting your search.  
The app will query the [Open Movie Database](http://www.omdbapi.com/).
